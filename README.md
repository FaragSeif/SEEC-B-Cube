# SEEC-B-Cube
Implemention of a balancing cube system (Cubli) using the SEEC framework, an optimal control approach combining systematic exploration-exploitation with symbolic reasoning, achieving real-time stabilization of a 3D underactuated inverted pendulum, and expanding to arbitrary robotic systems in the future.
